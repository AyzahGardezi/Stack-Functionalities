# Stack Functionalities

The C file in the repository is a solution to a problem I solved on CodeWars when studying a Data Structures and Algorithms course in my undergraduate studies.

The solution has three functionalities of a stack (which is a last in first out data type):
1. Push - Adds an item to the top of the stack
2. Pop - Removes an item from the top of the stack.
3. Is empty - Is the stack empty?

The problem is available here: https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b24bcecd74b5be066000054
